1.
First build main-race.c. Examine the code so you can see the (hopefully obvious) data race in the code. 
Now run helgrind (by typing valgrind --tool=helgrind main-race) to see how it reports the race. 
Does it point to the right lines of code? What other information does it give to you?

_________________________________________________
This one shows how a thread is created a thread
there are no locks






2.
What happens when you remove one of the offending lines of code? 
Now add a lock around one of the updates to the shared variable, and then aroundboth.
What does helgrind report in each of these cases?
---------------------------------------------------------------
still the same as in ex. 1 - so not really understand....






3.
Now let’s look at main-deadlock.c. Examine the code. This code has aproblem known as deadlock
(which we discuss in much more depth in aforthcoming chapter). Can you see what problem it might have?
---------------------------------------
The Thread lock each other (lock 2 and 3) and so wait until the other one is finished






4.
Now run helgrindon this code. What does helgrind report?

Now run helgrind on main-deadlock-global.c. Examine the code; does it have the same problem
that main-deadlock.c has? Should helgrind be reporting the same error? 
What does this tell you about tools like helgrind?

At the beginning is already a lock. This is the first problem we have here. So no other
thread can lock. But there is no deadlock information anymore. So helgrind is no the 
best tool.






6.
Let’s next look at main-signal.c. This code uses a variable (done) to signal that the child 
is done and that the parent can now continue. 
Why is this code inefficient? (what does the parent end up spending its time doing, particularly
if the child thread takes a long time to complete?)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Parent starts spining. This takes a lot effort of the CPU instead of waiting for the child
to be done. Might take too long. Might take too much CPU.





7.
Now run helgrindon this program. What does it report? Is the code correct?

There is a data race which should not be. And some conflicts.
But the print is right. But because of the neagtive messages the code
seems to go in the wrong direction, means it's wrong.
(printf is a critical section)
___________________________________________________________________________






8.
Now look at a slightly modified version of the code, which is found in main-signal-cv.c
This version uses a condition variable to do the signaling (and associated lock). 
Why is this code preferred to the previous version? 
Is it correctness, or performance, or both?
------------------------------------------------
It is better, so correctness. Because this time the waiting time is integrated.





9.
Once again run helgrind on main-signal-cv. Does it report any errors?
